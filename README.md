# The Next Web Clone - Responsive Website

> In this project, my partner and I explored the tools that make a website to be responsive and fit all screen sizes.
> Positioning and layout were particularly important to achive this goal.
> We learned more about the use of Media Queries.
> We deepened our understanding of the viewport meta attribute and how it affects the content of a webpage.
